## hostname and /etc/hosts management
# cloud-init can handle updating some entries in /etc/hosts,
# and can set your hostname for you.
#
# if you do nothing you'll end up with:
#  * /etc/hostname (and `hostname`) managed via: 'preserve_hostame: false'
#    if you do not change /etc/hostname, it will be updated with the cloud
#    provided hostname on each boot.  If you make a change, then manual
#    maintenance takes over, and cloud-init will not modify it.
#
#  * /etc/hosts managed via: 'manage_etc_hosts: false'
#    cloud-init will not manage /etc/hosts at all.  It is in full manual
#    maintenance mode.
#
# You can change the above behavior with the following config variables:
#  Remember that these can be set in cloud-config via user-data,
#  /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg or any file in /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg.d/
#
# == Hostname management (via /etc/hostname) ==
#  * preserve_hostname:
#      default: False
#      If this option is set to True, then /etc/hostname will never updated
#      The default behavior is to update it if it has not been modified by
#      the user.
#
#  * hostname:
#      this option will be used wherever the 'hostname' is needed
#      simply substitute it in the description above.
#      ** If you wish to set your hostname, set it here **
#      default: 'hostname' as returned by the metadata service
#               on EC2, the hostname portion of 'local-hostname' is used
#               which is something like 'ip-10-244-170-199'
#
#  * fqdn:
#      this option will be used wherever 'fqdn' is needed.
#      simply substitue it in the description above.
#      default: fqdn as returned by the metadata service.  on EC2 'hostname'
#               is used, so this is like: ip-10-244-170-199.ec2.internal
#
#hostname: raspberrypi
#fqdn: raspberrypi.local

# This will cause the set+update hostname module to not operate (if true)
preserve_hostname: false

## /etc/hosts management
#
# The cloud-config variable that covers management of /etc/hosts is 
# 'manage_etc_hosts'
#
# By default, its value is 'false' (boolean False)
#
#  * manage_etc_hosts:
#      default: false
#
#    false:
#      cloud-init will not modify /etc/hosts at all.  
#      * Whatever is present at instance boot time will be present after boot.
#      * User changes will not be overwritten
#
#    true or 'template':
#      on every boot, /etc/hosts will be re-written from 
#      /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl.
#      The strings '$hostname' and '$fqdn' are replaced in the template
#      with the appropriate values.
#      To make modifications persistant across a reboot, you must make 
#      modificatoins to /etc/cloud/templates/hosts.tmpl
#
#    localhost:
#      This option ensures that an entry is present for fqdn as described in
#      section 5.1.2 of the debian manual 
#      http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-reference/ch05.en.html
#
#      cloud-init will generally own the 127.0.1.1 entry, and will update 
#      it to the hostname and fqdn on every boot.  All other entries will
#      be left as is.  'ping `hostname`' will ping 127.0.1.1
#
#      If you want a fqdn entry with aliases other than 'hostname' to resolve
#      to a localhost interface, you'll need to use something other than 
#      127.0.1.1.  For example:
#        127.0.1.2 myhost.fqdn.example.com myhost whatup.example.com
#
manage_etc_hosts: false

## This module is intended to manage resolv.conf in environments where early 
# configuration of resolv.conf is necessary for further bootstrapping and/or
# where configuration management such as puppet or chef own dns configuration.
# As Debian/Ubuntu will, by default, utilize resovlconf, and similarly RedHat
# will use sysconfig, this module is likely to be of little use unless those
# are configured correctly.
#

#  nameservers: [ 127.0.0.1 ]
#  domain: local
#  searchdomains: [ local ]

## resize_rootfs should the / filesytem be resized on first boot
# this allows you to launch an instance with a larger disk / partition
# and have the instance automatically grow / to accomoddate it
# set to 'False' to disable
# by default, the resizefs is done early in boot, and blocks
# if resize_rootfs is set to 'noblock', then it will be run in parallel
#
#resize_rootfs: true

## manual cache clean.
#  By default, the link from /var/lib/cloud/instance to
#  the specific instance in /var/lib/cloud/instances/ is removed on every
#  boot.  The cloud-init code then searches for a DataSource on every boot
#  if your DataSource will not be present on every boot, then you can set
#  this option to 'True', and maintain (remove) that link before the image
#  will be booted as a new instance.
# default is False
#manual_cache_clean: False

## Add groups to the system
# The following example adds the ubuntu group with members 'root' and 'sys'
# and the empty group cloud-users.
#
#groups:
#  - ubuntu: [root,sys]
#  - cloud-users

## Add users to the system. Users are added after groups are added.
# Valid Values:
#   name: The user's login name
#   gecos: The user name's real name, i.e. "Bob B. Smith"
#   homedir: Optional. Set to the local path you want to use. Defaults to
#           /home/<username>
#   primary_group: define the primary group. Defaults to a new group created
#           named after the user.
#   groups:  Optional. Additional groups to add the user to. Defaults to none
#   selinux_user:  Optional. The SELinux user for the user's login, such as
#           "staff_u". When this is omitted the system will select the default
#           SELinux user.
#   lock_passwd: Defaults to true. Lock the password to disable password login
#   inactive: Create the user as inactive
#   passwd: The hash -- not the password itself -- of the password you want
#           to use for this user. You can generate a safe hash via:
#               mkpasswd --method=SHA-512 --rounds=4096
#           (the above command would create from stdin an SHA-512 password hash
#           with 4096 salt rounds)
#
#           Please note: while the use of a hashed password is better than
#               plain text, the use of this feature is not ideal. Also,
#               using a high number of salting rounds will help, but it should
#               not be relied upon.
#
#               To highlight this risk, running John the Ripper against the
#               example hash above, with a readily available wordlist, revealed
#               the true password in 12 seconds on a i7-2620QM.
#
#               In other words, this feature is a potential security risk and is
#               provided for your convenience only. If you do not fully trust the
#               medium over which your cloud-config will be transmitted, then you
#               should use SSH authentication only.
#
#               You have thus been warned.
#   no_create_home: When set to true, do not create home directory.
#   no_user_group: When set to true, do not create a group named after the user.
#   no_log_init: When set to true, do not initialize lastlog and faillog database.
#   ssh_import_id: Optional. Import SSH ids
#   ssh_authorized_keys: Optional. [list] Add keys to user's authorized keys file
#   ssh_redirect_user: Optional. [bool] Set true to block ssh logins for cloud
#       ssh public keys and emit a message redirecting logins to
#       use <default_username> instead. This option only disables cloud
#       provided public-keys. An error will be raised if ssh_authorized_keys
#       or ssh_import_id is provided for the same user.
# 
#       ssh_authorized_keys.
#   sudo: Defaults to none. Accepts a sudo rule string, a list of sudo rule
#         strings or False to explicitly deny sudo usage. Examples:
#
#         Allow a user unrestricted sudo access.
#             sudo:  ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
#
#         Adding multiple sudo rule strings.
#             sudo:
#               - ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:/bin/mysql
#               - ALL=(ALL) ALL
#
#         Prevent sudo access for a user.
#             sudo: False
#
#         Note: Please double check your syntax and make sure it is valid.
#               cloud-init does not parse/check the syntax of the sudo
#               directive.
#   system: Create the user as a system user. This means no home directory.
#   snapuser: Create a Snappy (Ubuntu-Core) user via the snap create-user
#             command available on Ubuntu systems.  If the user has an account
#             on the Ubuntu SSO, specifying the email will allow snap to
#             request a username and any public ssh keys and will import
#             these into the system with username specifed by SSO account.
#             If 'username' is not set in SSO, then username will be the
#             shortname before the email domain.
#
# Default user creation:
# Unless you define users, you will get a 'ubuntu' user on ubuntu systems with the
# legacy permission (no password sudo, locked user, etc). If however, you want
# to have the 'ubuntu' user in addition to other users, you need to instruct
# cloud-init that you also want the default user. To do this use the following
# syntax:
#    users:
#      - default
#      - bob
#      - ....
#  foobar: ...
#
# users[0] (the first user in users) overrides the user directive.
#
# The 'default' user above references the distro's config:
# system_info:
#   default_user:
#    name: Ubuntu
#    plain_text_passwd: 'ubuntu'
#    home: /home/ubuntu
#    shell: /bin/bash
#    lock_passwd: True
#    gecos: Ubuntu
# groups: [adm, audio, cdrom, dialout, floppy, video, plugdev, dip, netdev]
#
# A set of users which may be applied and/or used by various modules
# when a 'default' entry is found it will reference the 'default_user'
# from the distro configuration specified below
#users:
#   - default

# If this is set, 'root' will not be able to ssh in and they 
# will get a message to login instead as the above $user (debian)
disable_root: true

## When cloud-init is finished running including having run 
# cloud_init_modules, then it will run this command.  The default
# is to emit an upstart signal as shown below.  If the value is a
# list, it will be passed to Popen.  If it is a string, it will be
# invoked through 'sh -c'.
# 
# default value:
# cc_ready_cmd: [ initctl, emit, cloud-config, CLOUD_CFG=/var/lib/instance//cloud-config.txt ]
# example:
# cc_ready_cmd: [ sh, -c, 'echo HI MOM > /tmp/file' ]

## final_message
# default: cloud-init boot finished at $TIMESTAMP. Up $UPTIME seconds
# this message is written by cloud-final when the system is finished
# its first boot.
# This message is rendered as if it were a template.  If you
# want jinja, you have to start the line with '## template:jinja\n'
final_message: "The system is finally up, after $UPTIME seconds"

## phone_home: if this dictionary is present, then the phone_home
# cloud-config module will post specified data back to the given
# url
# default: none
# phone_home:
#  url: http://my.foo.bar/$INSTANCE/
#  post: all
#  tries: 10
#
#phone_home:
# url: http://my.example.com/$INSTANCE_ID/
# post: [ pub_key_dsa, pub_key_rsa, pub_key_ecdsa, instance_id ]
