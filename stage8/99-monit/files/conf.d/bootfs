## Check filesystem permissions, uid, gid, space and inode usage. Other services,
## such as databases, may depend on this resource and an automatically graceful
## stop may be cascaded to them before the filesystem will become full and data
## lost.

check filesystem bootfs with path /boot
    if space usage > 90% for 5 times within 15 cycles then alert
    if changed fsflags then alert
